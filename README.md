# FIRESTARTER - A Processor Stress Test Utility

FIRESTARTER maximizes the energy consumption of 64-Bit x86 processors by
generating heavy load on the execution units as well as transferring data
between the cores and multiple levels of the memory hierarchy.

WARNING: This software REALLY comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY! Some systems cannot
handle the high load and crash due to overheating. It cannot be ruled out that
the stress test damages the hardware! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Supported CPU Microarchitectures
- Intel Nehalem, Westmere, Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, Haswell, Skylake, Knights Landing
- AMD Bulldozer (experimental), Zen, Zen+, Zen2

## Building FIRESTARTER

FIRESTARTER can be build under Linux, Windows and macOS with CMake.

GCC (>=7) or Clang (>=9) is supported.

CMake option                  | Description
:---------------------------- | :----------------------------
`FIRESTARTER_BUILD_TYPE`      | Can be any of `FIRESTARTER`, `FIRESTARTER_CUDA`, or `FIRESTARTER_CUDA_ONLY`. Default `FIRESTARTER`
`FIRESTARTER_LINK_STATIC`     | Link FIRESTARTER as a static binary. Note, dlopen is not supported in static binaries. This option is not available on macOS or with CUDA enabled. Default `ON`
`FIRESTARTER_BUILD_HWLOC`     | Build hwloc dependency. Default `ON`
`FIRESTARTER_THREAD_AFFINITY` | Enable FIRESTARTER to set affinity to hardware threads. Default `ON`

## Metrics

The Linux version of FIRESTARTER supports to collect metrics during runtime.
Available metrics can be shown with `--list-metrics`.  Default metrics are
`perf-ipc`, `perf-freq`, `ipc-estimate` and `sysfs-powercap-rapl`.

### Custom Metrics

If one would like to use custom metrics, e.g. an external power measurement,
`--metric-from-stdin=NAME` allows metric values to be passed via stdin in the
following format: `{NAME} {TIME SINCE EPOCH IN NS} {ABSOLUT METRIC VALUE
(double)}\n`.  See
[here](https://github.com/tud-zih-energy/FIRESTARTER/blob/master/examples/test_metric.py)
for a basic example.

## Metric Recording

The Linux version of FIRESTARTER has the option to output the collected metric
values by specifying `--measurement`.  Options `--start-delta (default 5000ms)`
and `--stop-delta (default 2000ms)` specify a time in milliseconds in which
metric values should be ignored.  After a run, the output will be printed in CSV
format to stdout.

### Measurement Example

Measure all available metrics for 15 minutes disregarding the first 5 minutes
and last two seconds (default to `--stop-delta`).
```
FIRESTARTER --measurement --start-delta=300000 -t 900
```

## Optimization

The Linux version of FIRESTARTER has the option to optimize itself using
evolutionary algorithms.  It currently supports the multiobjective algorithm
NSGA2, selected by `--optimize=NSGA2`.

The evolutionary algorithm evaluates individuals one after another.  Each
evaluation of a given individual is `-t | --timeout` seconds long.  Selecting a
long enough time for letting the power consumption stabilize, but not too long
as this will leed to a much longer optimization timespan.  During this time
metrics are collected and the selected metrics (`--optimization-metrics`) are
used for assigning a fitness (specify at least two metrics for a multiobjective
algorithm).  The optimization result depends on the accuracy of the power
measurment.  The `sysfs-powercap-rapl` metric correlates strongly with the
actual system power consumption on Intel processors since Haswell, see [An
Energy Efficiency Feature Survey of the Intel Haswell
Processor](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPDPSW.2015.70).

Individuals are made of different instruction groups and their ratios to one
another.  Without specifying the `--run-instruction-groups` option, preselected
instruction groups will be used for optimization.  Setting this option allows
the user to select different instruction group, e.g. for optimizing FIRESTARTER
on a not yet optimized microarchitecture.  The format of this is the same as
shown by `-a | --avail`.  All available instruction groups can be listed with
`--list-instruction-groups`.

The number of individuals per generation (`--individuals`) and the number of
generations (`--generation`) are both set 20 per default.

Before the optimization runs, a user-defined period of preheating of the CPU is
carried out.  Option `--preheat` defaults to 240 seconds.

After the optimization finishes the acquired data will be written to
`{HOSTNAME}_${STARTTIME}.json` if not specified otherwise with the option
`--optimize-outfile`.  An [IPython
Notebook](https://github.com/tud-zih-energy/FIRESTARTER/blob/master/examples/Evaluation_Notebook/Evaluation_Notebook.ipynb)
is provided for basic visualization.

### The NSGA2 Algorithm

The NSGA2 algorithm, as described in [A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic
algorithm: NSGA-II](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/4235.996017), is a
multiobjective algorithm allowing FIRESTARTER to optimize with two (or more)
metrics.  This is relevant because adding the IPC (instruction per cycle) metric
supports the optimization algorithm to converge towards higher power
consumption.  Parameters of the algorithm can be tweaked using `--nsga2-cr` and
`--nsga2-m`.

### Optimization Examples

Optimize FIRESTARTER with NSGA2 and `sysfs-powercap-rapl` and `perf-ipc` metric.
The duration for the evaluation of a setting is 20s.  `-a | --avail` lists the
default instruction groups for the current platform.
```
FIRESTARTER -t 20 --optimize=NSGA2 --optimization-metric sysfs-powercap-rapl,perf-ipc
```

If `perf-ipc` is not available use `ipc-estimate`
```
FIRESTARTER -t 20 --optimize=NSGA2 --optimization-metric sysfs-powercap-rapl,ipc-estimate
```
