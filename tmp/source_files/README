###############################################################################

FIRESTARTER maximizes the energy consumption of 64-Bit x86 processors by
generating heavy load on the execution units as well as transferring data
between the cores and multiple levels of the memory hierarchy.

Supported CPU microarchitectures
- Intel Nehalem
- Intel Westmere
- Intel Sandy Bridge
- Intel Ivy Bridge
- Intel Haswell
- Intel Skylake
- Intel Knights Landing
- AMD Bulldozer (experimental)

Since version 1.1 it is also possible to create alternating and repetitive
patterns of high load and idle (-l and -p parameters).
$CUDA
$CUDA Since version 1.3 it is also possible to stress Nvidia GPUs with support for 
$CUDA CUDA 5.0 or later (FIRESTARTER_CUDA)
$WIN64
$WIN64 Since version 1.x a windows version is included (FIRESTARTER_win64.exe)

WARNING: This software REALLY comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY! Some systems cannot
handle the high load and crash due to overheating. It cannot be ruled out that
the stress test damages the hardware! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Usage: 
 FIRESTARTER [Options]
$CUDA  FIRESTARTER_CUDA [Options]

Options:

-h         | --help             display usage information
-v         | --version          display version information
-c         | --copyright        display copyright information
-w         | --warranty         display warranty information
-q         | --quiet            disable output to stdout
-r         | --report           display additional information (overridden by -q)
-a         | --avail            list available functions
-i ID      | --function=ID      specify integer ID of the load-function to be
                                used (as listed by --avail)
-t TIMEOUT | --timeout=TIMEOUT  set timeout (seconds) after which FIRESTARTER
                                terminates itself, default: no timeout
-l LOAD    | --load=LOAD        set the percentage of high load to LOAD (%),
                                default 100, valid values: 0 <= LOAD <= 100,
                                threads will be idle in the remaining time,
                                frequency of load changes is determined by -p
                                This option does NOT influence the GPU workload.
-p PERIOD  | --period=PERIOD    set the interval length to PERIOD (us),
                                default: 100, each interval contains a high
                                load and an idle phase, the percentage of
                                high load is defined by -l
                                This option does NOT influence the GPU workload.
-n COUNT   | --threads=COUNT    specify the number of threads
                                cannot be combined with -b | --bind, which
                                implicitly specifies the number of threads
-b CPULIST | --bind=CPULIST     select certain CPUs
                                CPULIST format: "x,y,z", "x-y", "x-y/step",
                                and any combination of the above
                                cannot be combined with -n | --threads
$CUDA
$CUDA CUDA Options:
$CUDA -g         | --gpus             number of gpus to use (default: all)
$CUDA -f         | --usegpufloat      use single precision matrix multiplications instead of double
$CUDA -m         | --matrixsize       size of the Matrix to calculate (default: 12288)

Examples:

./FIRESTARTER                    - starts FIRESTARTER without timeout
./FIRESTARTER -t 300             - starts a 5 minute run of FIRESTARTER
./FIRESTARTER -l 50 -t 600       - starts a 10 minute run of FIRESTARTER with
                                   50% high load and 50% idle time on CPUs and full load on GPUs
./FIRESTARTER -l 75 -p 2000000   - starts FIRESTARTER with an interval length
                                   of 2 seconds, 1.5s high load and 0.5s idle on CPUs and full load on GPUs

Build from source:
1) edit Makefile if necessary (compiler, flags)
2) build with: make [target]
       
possible targets:
 - linux (default): build 64 bit linux executable "FIRESTARTER"
$CUDA  - cuda:            build 64 bit linux executable with additional CUDA support "FIRESTARTER_CUDA"
$WIN64  - win64:           build 64 bit windows executable "FIRESTARTER_win64.exe"
$ALL  - all:             build all executables

note:
- FIRESTARTER typically uses the most advanced SIMD instructions that are
  available on the supported processor architectures. Therefore, an up-to-date
  compiler with support for the latest ISA extensions is required.
$WIN64 - the windows version (target win64/all) is only tested using mingw-w64
$WIN64   compilers under Linux for compilation. Building FIRESTARTER in a windows
$WIN64   environment may need adoption.
