FIRESTARTER:

run ./FIRESTARTER

run 'make' to rebuild from source

FIRESTARTER_CUDA:

dependencies:	nvidia-cuda >=5.0
		gcc >=4.4

run ./FIRESTARTER_CUDA

By default, this tool is linked with nvidia-cuda/6.5
If you have an newer/older version you need to recompile: `make clean; make cuda`
Be sure to have the correct LINUX_CUDA_PATH in the Makefile.

Troubleshooting:
- older GPUs without support for double precision only work with the -f or --usegpufloat switch
- if there appears an 'API mismatch' error, check for correct nvidia-drivers and kernel modules installation
- if GPU Initialization takes too much time (like 15-30 seconds), make sure that persistence mode is enabled (use: nvidia-smi --persistence-mode=1)
